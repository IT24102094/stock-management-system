# Database Fix Summary

## Issue Encountered
The application failed to start with the error:
```
You have an error in your SQL syntax... near 'IF NOT EXISTS idx_users_username'
```

## Root Cause
MySQL 8.0.33 does **not** support `IF NOT EXISTS` clause in `CREATE INDEX` statements. This syntax was only introduced in MySQL 8.0.32+, but the exact syntax is different from what was used.

## Solution Applied
Removed `IF NOT EXISTS` from all `CREATE INDEX` statements across all schema files since the database was freshly reset.

### Files Modified:
1. **01-core-tables.sql** - Removed `IF NOT EXISTS` from 7 index statements
2. **02-inventory-tables.sql** - Removed `IF NOT EXISTS` from 5 index statements
3. **03-people-management-tables.sql** - Removed `IF NOT EXISTS` from 8 index statements
4. **04-sales-tables.sql** - Removed `IF NOT EXISTS` from 6 index statements
5. **05-promotions-discounts-tables.sql** - Removed `IF NOT EXISTS` from 5 index statements

## Result
✅ Application started successfully on **Tomcat port 8080**
✅ All database tables created with new `item` table structure
✅ Sample data loaded successfully
✅ Users created with proper roles

## Login Credentials
- **Admin User**: `admin` / `admin123`
- **Other Users**: All can login with password `password123`
  - `stockmgr` - STOCK_MANAGER role
  - `sales1` - SALES_STAFF role
  - `hr1` - HR_STAFF role
  - `demo_inactive` - SALES_STAFF (inactive)

## Application URL
http://localhost:8080

## Database Structure
- **Item Table**: Upgraded with BIGINT id, DECIMAL price, SKU, description, timestamps
- **No Products Table**: Consolidated into single `item` table
- **All Foreign Keys**: Updated to reference `item` table
- **Indexes**: Created successfully without conflicts

## Next Steps
1. Test inventory management features
2. Test bills creation with item table
3. Test promotions and discounts
4. Verify CRUD operations on items

## Notes
- The `IF NOT EXISTS` clause for indexes is a MySQL 8.0.32+ feature with specific syntax
- For fresh database setups, it's not needed since tables are being created for the first time
- Future migrations should use conditional index creation through stored procedures or application logic if needed
