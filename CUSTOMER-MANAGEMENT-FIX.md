# Customer Management Issues - Fix Summary

## Issues Identified
1. **White label error when clicking View/Edit buttons** - Missing `edit.html` template
2. **Profile pictures not showing as round shapes** - Incorrect CSS styling

## Root Causes

### Issue 1: Missing Edit Template
**Problem:**
- The Edit button in `customers/list.html` linked to `/customers/edit/{id}`
- The controller method `CustomerWebController.showEditForm()` was properly implemented
- But the template file `customers/edit.html` was missing
- This caused a 404 error which showed as a white label error page

**Evidence:**
```java
// Controller method exists (line 113 in CustomerWebController.java)
@GetMapping("/edit/{id}")
public String showEditForm(@PathVariable Long id, Model model, RedirectAttributes redirectAttributes) {
    // ... implementation exists
    return "customers/edit";  // Template was missing!
}
```

### Issue 2: Profile Picture Not Round
**Problem:**
- The CSS class `.customer-img` had rectangular styling
- Missing `border-radius: 50%` to make it circular
- Image was full width instead of fixed dimensions

**Before (Problematic CSS):**
```css
.customer-img {
    height: 120px;
    object-fit: cover;
    border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);
    width: 100%;
}
```

## Solutions Applied

### Fix 1: Created Missing Edit Template
Created `src/main/resources/templates/customers/edit.html` with:

**Features:**
- Pre-populated form with existing customer data using Thymeleaf
- All fields from create form plus:
  - Read-only Customer ID field
  - Status toggle (Active/Inactive)
  - "View Details" button to navigate to view page
  - "Delete Current Photo" button for existing photos
- Photo preview with current customer photo
- Form validation
- Consistent styling with other customer pages

**Key Sections:**
1. **Basic Information** - Name, email, phone, status
2. **Address Information** - Address, city, postal code, country
3. **Additional Information** - Membership level, loyalty points, notes
4. **Profile Photo** - Upload new photo or delete existing one

### Fix 2: Updated Profile Picture Styling
Modified `.customer-img` CSS class in `customers/list.html`:

**After (Fixed CSS):**
```css
.customer-img {
    height: 120px;
    width: 120px;
    object-fit: cover;
    border-radius: 50%;           /* Makes it circular */
    margin: 1rem auto;
    display: block;                /* Centers it */
    border: 3px solid var(--border-color);  /* Nice border */
}
```

**Changes:**
1. Added `border-radius: 50%` for circular shape
2. Fixed width to 120px (matching height) for perfect circle
3. Changed to `display: block` with `margin: 1rem auto` for centering
4. Added 3px border for better visual definition
5. Removed `width: 100%` that was stretching the image

## Files Modified

1. **Created:** `src/main/resources/templates/customers/edit.html`
   - New file with complete edit form functionality
   - 210 lines of HTML with Thymeleaf integration

2. **Modified:** `src/main/resources/templates/customers/list.html`
